    <h1>MY FIRST CLASS OF HTML</h1>
    <h3>INTRODUCTION : </h3>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It is not a programming language, but a markup language that tells the browser how to display content like text, images, links, and videos. HTML uses "tags" to structure content. It forms the foundation of every website and works together with CSS and JavaScript to create complete web pages.</p>
    <h3>STARTING :</h3>
    <p>Today marked the beginning of my journey into the world of web development as I attended my first HTML (HyperText Markup Language) class. I was both excited and curious, eager to learn how websites are built and how content is structured on the internet.The class began with a basic introduction to HTML. Our instructor explained that HTML is the foundation of all web pages — it’s used to create the structure and layout of a website. We learned about HTML tags, which are used to format text, add images, create links, and build tables. For example, the h1 tag is used for headings, and the p tag is used for paragraphs.Today marked the beginning of my journey into the world of web development, and our very first class was about HTML (HyperText Markup Language). I was excited, curious, and a little nervous. But as the session progressed, I realized how simple yet powerful HTML is as the foundation of every website.

    <h3>BASIC TAGS OF HTML :</h3>
    <ul>
        <LI> <h4>html tag </h4></LI>
        <P>An HTML tag is a command used to tell the web browser what to show on the webpage and how to show it.</P>
        <li><h4> head tag</h4></li>
        <p>The head tag in HTML is used to store information about the webpage (called metadata). It’s placed at the top of the HTML document, just after the html tag and before the body tag.It does not show anything on the webpage itself, but it tells the browser important things</p>
        <li> <h4>body tag </h4></li>
        <p>The body tag in HTML is like the main part of a webpage where you put everything you want people to see.  
It holds all the text, pictures, and other stuff on the page.Whatever is inside the <body> tag will show up on the screen.Without it, the page would be empty.</p>
        <li><h4>heading tags</h4></li>
        <p>Heading tags in HTML are used to create titles or headings on a webpage. They help organize content and make it easier to read.</p> 
    </ul>
    <h3>ENDING OF CLASS :</h3>
    <p>My first HTML class was an exciting experience that opened a new world of web development for me. As the class came to an end, I felt motivated and eager to learn more about building websites. The session started with a brief introduction to HTML and its importance in creating web pages. I learned that HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and it is the basic building block of all websites.The instructor made everything easy to understand, and I could see how every website begins with just a few lines of HTML. It felt magical to write something and watch it appear in a web browser. I’m already looking forward to the next class.
        As the class ended, the teacher answered all our questions patiently and encouraged us to experiment with different tags. I felt confident that with more practice, I could improve my skills. The friendly atmosphere of the class made learning enjoyable, and I am looking forward to the next sessions.

Overall, the first HTML class was a great introduction to web development. It sparked my interest in technology and coding. I now understand that HTML is the foundation of every website, and learning it will allow me to bring my ideas to life on the internet. I am excited to continue this learning journey and explore more about web design and programming. This class was just the beginning of a new adventure!</p>
