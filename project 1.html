    <h1>WHAT IS AI AND IT ROLE IN OUR LIFE</h1>
    <h3>INTRODUCTION :</h3>
    <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most exciting and fastest-growing         technologies in the modern world. It refers to the ability of a computer or a robot to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence.</p>
    <h3>WHAT IS AI?</h3>
    <p>AI involves the development of machines and software that can think, reason, learn, and make decisions. These systems can process large amounts of data, recognize patterns, and improve over time without human intervention.</p>
    <h3>TYPES OF AI :</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)</li>
        <li>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</li>
        <li>Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>WHAT IS ANI?</h3>
    <p>Artificial Narrow Intelligence is designed to perform a specific task or a limited range of tasks. It doesn’t have real human-like intelligence or emotions—it can’t think, reason, or make decisions beyond its programmed purpose.</p>
    <h3>WHAT IS AGI?</h3>
    <p>AGI is capable of performing any intellectual task that a human can do. Unlike ANI, it’s not limited to one specific job. It can reason, solve problems, make decisions, and even learn new skills on its own—just like a person.</p>
    <h3>WHAT IS ASI?</h3>
    <p>ASI (Artificial Super Intelligence) is the most advanced form of artificial intelligence, which refers to a future AI that will be far more intelligent than the best human brains in every aspect—creativity, problem-solving, decision-making, emotional intelligence, and more.</p>
    <h3>ROLE OF AI IN OUR LIFE :</h3>
