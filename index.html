    <p>AI agents, agentic AI, and chatbots are transforming automation. Hereâ€™s what they mean:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Chatbots :</h3>
        </li>
        <p>Rule-based or AI-powered systems designed for simple, conversational tasks like answering FAQs or guiding users through processes.</p>
        <li>
            <h3>AI Agents :</h3>
        </li>
        <p>More advanced than chatbots, AI agents can perform complex tasks, make decisions, and interact with systems autonomously.</p>
        <li>
            <h3>Agentic AI :</h3>
        </li>
        <p>A subset of AI agents, agentic AI focuses on goal-driven behavior, proactively solving problems and adapting to new scenarios without human intervention.</p>
    </ol>
    <h3>Key Differences </h3>
    <p>Chatbots are limited to predefined scripts or basic AI, while AI agents and agentic AI can handle dynamic tasks and learn from interactions.</p>
    <p>In 2025, these technologies are used in customer service, workflow automation, and even creative problem-solving, making them essential for businesses.</p>
